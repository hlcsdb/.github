# Hul’q’umi’num’ Language and Culture Society

## Description

With the help of grant funding and support from the FPCC LTP and Development grants, the HLCS tech team created more than 100 language games, which led to creating new language materials with the help of Elders and reviving existing language lesson materials. The technologies that were utilized range from ones that newcomers to making digital language games can use, (e.g. Flippity with Google Sheets) ones that work for people who are more experienced with digital interfaces (e.g. H5P), or those that are interested in making immersive games using state-of-the-art technologies (e.g. Unity). These are now of these are now integrated into the language-learning site, [ta’ulthun sqwal](https://sqwal.hwulmuhwqun.ca), and the site geared towards young learners, [’iyus mumun’lh](https://iyus.hwulmuhwqun.ca).

The team has also been able to catalogue and process at least 600 legacy stories and has generated great momentum to editing stories to be published and shared back with the community. Work is done collaboratively using Google Sheets and Google Docs and media is hosted through a shared Google Drive, and a comprehensive internal catalogue currently exists as an [Airtable](https://airtable.com) that can be viewed and updated by those working on stories. This allows for dynamic backups and updates using the Airtable API as well as centralizing and regularizing metadata.

The team has also utilized Airtable to for the backend for the dictionary and other new language tools. This has allowed for a similar community-collaborative workflow that is used for the [current dictionary site](https://words.hwulmuhwqun.ca), an upcoming detailed/lightweight 'research' dictionary site for the purposes of quick word lookup for language learners, as well as some of the newly-developed language tools at https://hulqapps.ca.
